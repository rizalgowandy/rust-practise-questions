## FAQ

#### Where can I find solutions to the problems in this book ?

I have decided not to provide solutions to any problem in this book, you will have to use the long way(irc channels,
stackoverflow, etc).

The reason for this is so that you have to study the whole concept rather than a part of it because I feel a lot of new
learners simply go and check the solution after being stuck for the first time.

Though help will be provided in some questions as a form of `hint`

#### How can I be sure whether a question has a solution or not ?

Each and every question that appears in the book has been solved in at least in 1 way before making it's way in the book

#### Where can I find help ?

Some of the sources that are the most helpful are :

* [Discord Channel for beginners](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust)
* [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)

#### I am unable to solve so-and-so question, why ?

Mostly because you may be new to the language or to programming world itself, try again and keep on learning, you will
be able to eventually solve them with ease
